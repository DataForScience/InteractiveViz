# Interactive Visualization With Python
### Code and slides to accompany the online series of webinars: https://data4sci.com/interactive-data-visualization by Data For Science.

Our brains are highly developed visual processing machines. Weâ€™ve evolved highly sophisticated visual systems to quickly process large quantities of information. The power of visualization rests on its ability to encode data in a way that can be processed intuitively and accurately. 

As the quantity and complexity of data increases, the correct use of visualization will only become more important. In this course, we survey a range of techniques and tools to produce visually appealing and effective interactive visualizations using Jupyter notebooks, Bokeh and Plotly to make your data shine.
